Real Estate is a very exciting industry. Agencies usually have their offices on the best locations. They have
big windows and they show their latest objects for sale.

Traditionally, the storefronts of the agencies have been filled with static panels showing one image for an
object and this image needs to manually be replaced when the object is sold or some information about the
object has changed.

This is a solution that is relative inexpensive (at least in material), and just works.
However keeping the storefron up-to-date is tedious and time consuming.

are biddings, price changes or visit times.

We can also combine objects for sale with other messages, including corporate videos and why not advertisements
on services related to the

Castmill has already integrations for many real estate databases and can easily be integrated into new systems,
in any country. When the integration is completed, the users can easily find the objects and schedule them on the
screens.
