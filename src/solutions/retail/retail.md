Retail is probably one of the most common digital signage applications. The so-called, "last mile advertisement" is covered by
large or small screen close to the place of purchase.

Screens on retail also provide other functions such as _brand awareness_, _real-time information_, _offers_, _deals_ or can even be
used for decoration.

With Castmill you can easily control what and when to display on any of the screens placed on different malls or markets.

Screens have big effect both in storefronts as well as inside the store for providing information or marketing close to the
point of sale.
