Become a Castmill partner and deliver the best Digital Signage solution for your customers.

## Why become a partner?

Becoming a partner is a natural step for you that have a growing network of displays or
are planning to build one. As a partner, you will get your own Whitelabel instance of 
Castmill, where you can manage and control your users.


## How to become a partner?

Start by evaluating Castmill. You can easily signup and you will get a 30 days trial.
During the trial you will have access to most of the features, soo that you can test them out.

We have comprehensive documentation on how to get started so you can quickly evaluate the solution
using the "browser" player, and then move to real production players such as Raspberry Pi, Intel NUC,
Android, LG WebOS, and more.

If you are just starting with Digital Signage, you may want to consider the "Basic" plan, it is
an unexpensive way to get used to the platform and as your needs increase you can move to a
larger plan or sign for a Whitelabel solution.

At Castmill we will help you all the way in the process. With our support team you get your back
covered if you have any questions or issues.
