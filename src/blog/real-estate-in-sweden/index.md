Almost 5 years ago, Castmill was a complete newcomer in the real estate market. Today, with over 300 displays running in real-estate storefronts around Sweden, we are proud of being the largest supplier of digital signage for this market segment. Here are some of the reasons why. It all started with a partnership.

### The partnership

[Tylöprint](https://tyloprint.se) is a well-known Swedish company leader in providing print and signage solutions for the Real Estate market for over 35 years.

Tylöprint's deep knowledge of the market and understanding on the trends in the industry made it clear for them that a transition
to digital signage was a necesity. The old analog storefronts were to be upgraded to use modern digital displays, for live updates and a much nicer user experience.

Hampus Simonsson, CEO of Tylöprint, approached Castmill in the fall of 2017 to help them transition their traditional sign business to digital signage. They had access to hardware, they knew the market and the challenges around installations and support. But they needed a software solution both to run on their displays as well as to manage all the content. They needed something flexible and extensible, but also very easy to use.

The real-estate market is quite fragmented with many different providers of software solutions, there are 4 major suppliers of specialized software for the real estate market. Every supplier with their own vision and their own distinct APIs. Furthermore, every real-estate agency had their own design profile, and some of them had even their own specific integration APIs. The solution had to work in such a way that all data from the different estates beloging to a given office were automatically available in the Castmill application

It was clear from the start that a lot of custom integrations, as well as potentially hundreds of different templates where needed in order to fullfill the requirements of this industry, but we also could see the potential of the business case, so a partnership was stablished and soon after we started deploying the different integrations.

### The integrations

We started with an integration for one of the largest franchises in Sweden, called "Fastighetsbyrån". This franchise had over 400 offices all around Sweden, and had a very long and good relationship with Tylöprint, so it felt as a natural first customer. But this was not
without risks as they were also very demanding on the quality of our solutions. Besides they required a lot of different templates, for both
portrait and landscape displays.

After a bumpy start with the hardware that was not meeting all our requiremens as well as software issues, after about 6 months we
had a pretty stable solution and were able to continue to grow the business to other franchises. As mentioned there are 4 major
providers plus other custom software solutions for the real estate market, and we had to deal with all of them. One by one we started to integrate all these solutions, and we were able start getting traction from other franchises.

One of the biggest challenges we faced was that every franshise owner was an independent decision maker, so the sales process was
tedious and repetitive, however this job was performed basically by Tylöprint. Soon the word of mouth also helped other owners to jump onto the digital wagon.

### The future

There are still a lot of challenges for the future, even today, most of the real-state agencies have not upgraded to digital signage, but the process is ongoing. New competitors are arising of course, so we are always looking into ways to improve our solution, making it easier
to use and automating the process.
