Whether you just have a single digital signage screen or run a global network of screens you will definitely want to control what content they should show. In this article we will introduce the concept of playlists and how to work with them. A playlist contains all the images and videos that you want to display on a screen at a given point in time. You can also schedule different playlists to play at different times during the day. Keeping your content relevant to your target audience at all times is the key here and playlists help you do that.

If your screens are in a restaurant for example, you will probably have one playlist running in the morning with the breakfast menu, another playlist will run around lunchtime and additional playlists in the evening and night time.

If you run a network of screens across multiple sites you can use shared playlists to show the same content on all screens even though they belong to different users. Shared playlists can also be used as a collaboration tool allowing multiple users to work together on a single playlist. In a typical multi site installation there may be one centrally managed playlist and additional playlists for each site.  Similarly, in the cast of a franchise, a franchisor may use a shared playlist to push out content to all franchisees.

### Prerequisites

Before creating your first playlist, log in to Castmill or sign up for a [free trial](https://app.castmill.com).

### Creating a playlist

To create a playlist, go to the *Playlists* tab and click *Add Playlist*.

Give your playlist a name and leave *Landscape* layout selected. It is possible to
create more advanced multi-layout playlists but we'll save that for another day.
Now click *New Playlist*.

We now have a new empty playlist. Let's add some content to it!

### Uploading the content

Content is uploaded and managed in the *Medias* section. Once uploaded, each piece
of content can can be used in multiple playlists. There's no need to worry about
file formats by the way. Pretty much any image or video file format will work since we automatically convert all uploaded files to suitable formats and resolutions.

To upload your content click *Upload Media* and then *Choose files*.

Now select the files that you want to upload. As you can see multi-select is supported
so you can upload many files at once.

Click *Upload* to upload the selected files

When the upload has finished, press *OK*

The content was successfully uploaded and is now ready to use in your playlists.

### Adding the content to the playlist

Now go back to the *Playlists* tab where we created our playlist earlier. Select your playlist and drag in your uploaded
content to the *Organize Playlist* section.

We've now created our first playlist. In subsequent posts we'll walk you through how to use calendars to schedule which playlist is played when. We'll also dig deeper into the playlist concept and show the different playlist layouts, transitions and the concept of widgets.
