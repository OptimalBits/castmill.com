This is a quick introduction to how playlists work in Castmill. A playlist contains
all the images and videos that you want to display on a screen at a given point in time.
A good playlist should contain content relevant to your target audience and in this
guide we'll walk you through the steps needed to upload content and add it to a
playlist.

### Prerequisites

Before creating your first playlist, log in to Castmill or sign up for a [free trial](https://app.castmill.com).

### Creating a playlist

To create a playlist, go to the *Playlists* tab and click *Add Playlist*.

Give your playlist a name and leave *Landscape* layout selected. It is possible to
create more advanced multi-layout playlists but we'll save that for another day.
Now click *New Playlist*.

We now have a new empty playlist. Let's add some content to it!

### Uploading the content

Content is uploaded and managed in the *Medias* section. Once uploaded, each piece
of content can can be used in multiple playlists. There's no need to worry about
file formats by the way, pretty much any image or video file format will work.

To upload your content click *Upload Media* and then *Choose files*.

Now select the files that you want to upload. As you can see multi-select is supported
so you can upload many files at once.

Click *Upload* to upload the selected files

When the download has finished, press *OK*

The content is now uploaded and ready to use.

### Adding the content to the playlist

Now go back to the *Playlists* tab, select your playlist and drag in your uploaded
content to the *Organize Playlist* section.

We've now created our first playlist. In subsequent posts we'll walk you through
how to use calendars to schedule which playlist is played when. We'll also dig deeper
into the playlist concept and show the different playlist layouts, transitions and
the concept of widgets.

Stay tuned for more...
