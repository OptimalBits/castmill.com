When the pandemic run havoc in 2020, many businesses had to make quick changes in order to adapt to the
new situation.

"Lansförsäkringar" (LF) is one of the largest insurance companies in Sweden. Normally they would have daily meetings with their customers, however due to covid they could no longer offer an open office where
anybody could just walk in and make an appointment or talk to a representative. Furthermore, opening times and booking times where changing constantly, making it really difficult to keep it updated on their front
office windows.

The solution to this new reality was to use "Digital Signage", and due to our partnership with Tylöprint they
chose Castmill with great Vitrine Media screens provided and installed by Tylöprint.

LF wanted of course a fully automatic solution, as they know it is tedious to manually update the information of the screens everytime they change.

For this solution we delivered a set of custom dynamic templates. These templates fetch automatically the information for every office in real time: Opening times, booking times, and/or special warning messages.

Both the customer and us are extreamly happy with the result, a cost efficient solution quickly implemented and delivered to 10 different offices in Sweden.
